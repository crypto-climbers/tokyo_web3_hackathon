# Project Description
This project creates a single front end for the user to be able to interact with multiple DeFi protocols for becoming a liquidity provider, lender, stake,... In that sense, DeFi Vista is a multichain project that connects with the user's wallet and main DEXs, lending and staking protocols to provide an unique tool of portfolio management. In DeFi Vista users are able to see all assets they have in multiple blockchains, as well as assets locked in any sort of liquidity pool and its respective yield and overall performance.

# How it's Made
In order to aggregate the services provided for multiple DeFi projects, DeFi Vista connects to the user's wallet through rainbow kit. Once the wallet is connected, we interact with Chainlink oracle to get updated USD prices for tokens in customer's portfolio. To enable the transactions (swaps, liquidity providing,..) we utilize The Graph protocol to see smart contract status; UniSwap SDK, CowSwap SDK and ethers.js to interact with those smart contracts. Finally, the frontend was built using react, next.js and p5.js
